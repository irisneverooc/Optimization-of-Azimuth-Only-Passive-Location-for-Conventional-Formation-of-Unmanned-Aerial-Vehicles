# **Optimization of Azimuth Only Passive Location for Conventional Formation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles**

# **Abstract**

This article first uses the position estimation method of multi round optimization algorithm to obtain angle information from the signals transmitted and received by each drone. The quadratic optimization method is used to obtain the optimal solution for each round, which is compared with the standard template. After multiple rounds of adjustment, the position estimation accuracy of the drone formation is improved. The results show that using the optimization method proposed in this article and limited data, the positioning performance of unmanned aerial vehicle formations has been significantly improved. The standard deviation of relative positions between various drones in the formation decreases, and after multiple iterations, the standard deviation tends to 0.07, which can be ignored in real life.
